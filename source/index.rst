Our mission is to make accessible, flexible, tools for researchers (and budding researchers!) to create experiments to run in lab, online or in the classroom! 

With over 25000 users per month, PsychoPy is becoming a global leader in Psychology software. 

Weâ€™re passionate about equipping students with the skills needed for higher education. We believe there is nothing better than **learning by doing!** 

That's why we've developed some interactive PsychoPy experiments that are, and always will be, free to download and use. Just click the links below!
